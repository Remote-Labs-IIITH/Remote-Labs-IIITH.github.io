            <p>The apparatus used in the experiment is Glass rods, sunflower oil, water, glass
                beakers. (Make sure that the refractive index of the glass being used is similar to the

            <summary>Physics of the Experiment:</summary>
            <p>The main physics behind the experiment can be summarized as:
            <ul>
                <li>Whatever we see around us is due to the light which gets reflected from the object
                    and reaches our eyes.</li>
                <li>If this reflection is somehow removed, then no light will reach the observer and hence
                    he/she will not be able to see the object, effectively making it invisible.</li>
                <li>When the rod is immersed in water, due to different refractive indices of the water
                    and the glass, light bends to different degrees in both the mediums and hence we are
                    able to discern between the separate mediums.</li>
                <li>On the other hand, when the glass rod is immersed in oil, since the refractive indices
                    are similar, light behaves as if it is passing through a homogenous medium. As a result,
                    our eyes are not able to differentiate between the glass rod and the oil and hence the
                    rod appears to have disappeared.</li>
